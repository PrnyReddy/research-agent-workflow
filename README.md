# Multi-Agent AI Platform

## Overview

This project is a **modular, domain-agnostic AI agent platform**. It automates complex research and knowledge workflows using a multi-agent system, LLMs, and vector search. The architecture is designed to be easily extended to any industry or use caseâ€”insurance, finance, legal, healthcare, R&D, and more.

## Features

- **Frontend:** Next.js + Material UI for submitting research/knowledge tasks and real-time updates.
- **Backend:** FastAPI, scalable and serverless-ready.
- **Agents:** Modular multi-agent orchestration (LangChain/LangGraph)
- **Tools:**
  - Financial/news/web data retrieval
  - Website content scraping
  - Internal document search (vector DB)
  - Easy to add new tools/data sources
- **Monitoring:** Built-in agent and system monitoring

## Demo Use Case: Market/Competitor Research

- Submit a research task (e.g., "Compare Company A and Company B")
- Agents plan, retrieve, synthesize, and report findings from multiple sources
- Results are streamed to the frontend in real time

**Other possible workflows:**
- Literature review (R&D)
- News/trend aggregation
- Internal knowledge base Q&A
- Compliance document summarization

## How to Extend to Any Industry/Workflow

1. **Add new tools:**
   - Create a new tool in `backend/app/tools/` (e.g., for a new API or data source)
   - Register it in `agents.py` for agent use
2. **Add new agent workflows:**
   - Define new agent nodes or workflows in `agents.py`
   - Update the frontend to allow new task types
3. **Customize the UI:**
   - Add new task types or workflows to the dropdown in the frontend
   - Update instructions and help text for your use case
4. **Scale up:**
   - Add authentication, multi-user support, or SaaS features as needed
   - Deploy on serverless/cloud infrastructure

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Material UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Elasticsearch, LangChain, LangGraph
- **LLMs:** Gemini (default, easily swappable)
- **Other:** Beautiful Soup, PyPDF2, Python-docx

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add more demo workflows (e.g., literature review, compliance)
- Add user authentication and multi-tenancy
- Add dashboard for monitoring agent/system status
- Make agent tools/configuration dynamic via API
